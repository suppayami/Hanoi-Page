                Own opinions and feedback:
                <ul>
                    <li>Mostly ideas and design are perfectly completed.</li>
                    <li>Had some troubles with Google Chrome render at first.</li>
                    <li>Had some troubles with Internet Explorer, only has Internet Explorer 9 and 10 to test so far.</li>
                    <li>Use HTML5 and CSS3 in project so some older browsers do not work as intended.</li>
                    <li>Had some troubles with responsive design. Now works perfectly with device width large than or equal 800 pixels.</li>
                    <li>Students server does not allow encoding utf-8 which causes an error and three warnings when validating html.</li>
                    <li>Each browser has its own filter/render so it causes some errors and warnings when validating css.</li>
                </ul>
