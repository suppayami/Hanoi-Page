1. Pho
Phở is just one of many, many, MANY noodle soups in Vietnam. From a strictly linguistic standpoint, phở refers to the rice noodles, not the soup itself. But it's become synonymous with the staple soup served with various meat parts (usually beef or chicken), bean sprouts, lime wedges, the essential greens (basil, mint, cilantro, and onions), and whatever chili sauce and fish sauce you need to doctor up the broth to your liking.

2. Bun cha
You really can't go to Hanoi without trying bún chả. It comes with grilled pork sausage patties, a basket of herbs, bean sprouts, pickled veggies, and, once again, the ever-important nước chấm sauce (pour it over everything).

3. Banh cuon
The classic Hanoi preparation: a soft, delicately chewy steamed roll filled with minced pork and mushrooms, topped with crunchy fried shallots, and served with springy, slightly sweet slabs of cinnamon-y pork sausage. Each bite is topped with deep-fried shallot bits and must be dipped into that nước chấm sauce.

4. Cha ca
Chunks of fish are anointed with plenty of turmeric, then sizzled with heaps of dill and served with rice noodles. It’s a fragrant delight.
