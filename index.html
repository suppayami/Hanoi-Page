<div class="hidden-data" id="data-hoan-kiem">
	<h1>Hoan Kiem Lake</h1>
	Situated in the heart of Hanoi, the group structure Thap Rua (Turtle Tower) and Ngoc island with Ngoc Son temple, Pen tower and The Huc bridge have since become prominent city icons.
</div>

<div class="hidden-data" id="data-van-mieu">
	<h1>Temple of Literature</h1>
	The oldest and possibly the finest architectural complex in Hanoi, Van Mieu or Temple of Literature, was established in 1070, has became a original center for higher learning, educating future mandarins for more than seven centuries.
</div>

<div class="hidden-data" id="data-pho-co">
	<h1>Hanoi Old Quarter</h1>
	Hanoi's Old Quarter, or 36 Pho Phuong (36 Streets), with over a thousand years of history, remains one of Vietnam's most lively and unusual places by small artisans and merchants.
</div>

<div class="hidden-data" id="data-pho">
	<h1>Pho</h1>
	Pho is just one of many noodle soups in Vietnam. From a strictly linguistic standpoint, pho refers to the rice noodles, not the soup itself. But it's become synonymous with the staple soup served with various meat parts (usually beef or chicken), bean sprouts, lime wedges, the essential greens (basil, mint, cilantro, and onions), and whatever chili sauce and fish sauce you need to doctor up the broth to your liking.
</div>

<div class="hidden-data" id="data-bun-cha">
	<h1>Bun cha</h1>
	You really can't go to Hanoi without trying Bun cha. It comes with grilled pork sausage patties, a basket of herbs, bean sprouts, pickled veggies, and the ever-important <em>nuoc cham</em> sauce (pour it over everything).
</div>

<div class="hidden-data" id="data-banh-cuon">
	<h1>Banh cuon</h1>
	The classic Hanoi preparation: a soft, delicately chewy steamed roll filled with minced pork and mushrooms, topped with crunchy fried shallots, and served with springy, slightly sweet slabs of cinnamon-y pork sausage. Each bite is topped with deep-fried shallot bits and must be dipped into that <em>nuoc cham</em> sauce.
</div>

<div class="hidden-data" id="data-cha-ca">
	<h1>Cha ca</h1>
	Chunks of fish are anointed with plenty of turmeric, then sizzled with heaps of dill and served with rice noodles. Itâ€™s a fragrant delight.
</div>

<div class="hidden-data" id="data-com">
	<h1>Com</h1>
	"Com" (green sticky rice) is a delicacy that is made only in autumn and cherished by all Vietnamese. For Hanoians, nothing evokes autumn like the taste of young rice from Vong Village, the grain so sweetly scented that they left a lasting impression.
